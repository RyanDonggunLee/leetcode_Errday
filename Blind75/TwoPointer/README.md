# Two Pointer

Two pointers is a more general version of sliding window where the pointers can cross each other and can be on different arrays.

When you are given two arrays to process, it is common to have one index per array (pointer) to traverse/compare the both of them, incrementing one of the pointers when relevant. For example, we use this approach to merge two sorted arrays.
